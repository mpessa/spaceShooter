1 boss entity - completed
1 powerup - completed
At least 12 ships for each level - completed

Other items:
Background music for regular gameplay, boss fights, and transition/beginning screens was included. Sound effects are included for ships firing, collisions, player death, powerup acquisition, and one enemy. A pause function was also implemented which also allows for the game to be exited.

How to play:

	Controls:
	A - Move ship left
